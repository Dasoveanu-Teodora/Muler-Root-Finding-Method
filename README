Muller's Method
Most of the root-finding methods that we have considered so far have approximated the function in the neighborhood of the root by a straight line.
Muller's method is based on approximating the function in the neighborhood of the root by a quadratic polynomial.
A second-degree polynomial is made to fit three points near a root, at $ x_0,x_1,x_2$ with $ x_0$ between $ x_1$, and $ x_2$.
The proper zero of this quadratic, using the quadratic formula, is used as the improved estimate of the root.
A quadratic equation that fits through three points in the vicinity of a root, in the form  a*u^2 + b*u + c

Transform axes to pass through the middle point, by letting $ u=x-x_0$. Let $ h_1=x_1-x_0$ and $ h_2=x_0-x_2$. We evaluate the coefficients by evaluating $ p_2(\nu)$ at the three points:

$ u =0: a(0)^2 + b(0) + c=f_0$
$ u =h_1:  ah_1^2 + bh_1 + c =f_1$
$ u =-h_2:  ah_2^2 -bh_2 + c=f_2$

From the first equation, $ c=f_0$. Letting $ h_2/h_1=\gamma$, we can solve the other two equations for a, and b

Transform axes to pass through the middle point, by letting $ \nu=x-x_0$. Let $ h_1=x_1-x_0$ and $ h_2=x_0-x_2$. We evaluate the coefficients by evaluating $ p_2(\nu)$ at the three points:

$ u =0: a(0)^2 + b(0) + c=f_0$
$ u =h_1:  ah_1^2 + bh_1 + c =f_1$
$ u =-h_2:  ah_2^2 -bh_2 + c=f_2$

From the first equation, $ c=f_0$. Letting $ h_2/h_1=\gamma$, we can solve the other two equations for a, and b.
$\displaystyle a=\frac{\gamma f_1-f_0(1+\gamma)+f_2}{\gamma h_1^2(1+\gamma)}, b=\frac{f_1-f_0-ah_1^2}{h_1}
$
After computing a, b, and c, we solve for the root of $ a\nu^2 + b\nu + c$ by the quadratic formula
$\displaystyle \nu_{1,2}=\frac{2c}{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}, \nu=x-x_0, root=x_0-\frac{2c}{b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}
